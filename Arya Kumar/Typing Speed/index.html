            <p>As You Like It is a play by William Shakespeare that tells the story of Rosalind, the daughter of a banished duke, who falls in love with Orlando, the son of one of her father's courtiers. After being banished from court, Rosalind disguises herself as a man named Ganymede and flees to the Forest of Arden with her cousin Celia and the court jester Touchstone. There, they encounter various characters, including the shepherd Silvius, who is in love with the disdainful Phoebe, and the melancholic Jaques. Rosalind, still disguised as Ganymede, meets Orlando in the forest and convinces him to woo her as if she were Rosalind, in order to cure him of his lovesickness. Meanwhile, Celia falls in love with a young man named Oliver, who is the brother of Orlando. In the end, all the couples are married, including Rosalind and Orlando, and Duke Frederick, who had banished Rosalind, repents and restores her father to his rightful place. The play is a romantic comedy that explores themes of love, gender, and the natural world</p>
